# Title of Protocol
## Purpose
Briefly describe the background of the experiment, referencing any necessary publications or prior experiments. Include the hypothesis tested or the information intended to be gained. Give an overview of the experimental design that can be understood at a glance, including the major test and control groups and the independent and dependent variables.

# Materials
Include instructions for any necessary solutions. More information is generally better, but do not distract from the content by including trivial examples. Common laboratory stocks and buffers can be referenced in a separate document and deviations can be described here as necessary.

# Procedure
## Subsection1
1.	Break long procedures into appropriate subsections
2.	Keep the steps brief but informative.
	1.	Include supplemental information and caveats as a substep. Multiple substeps and sub-substeps are strongly discouraged.

## Subsection2
3.	Numbering can be maintained or restarted between sections
4.	Detailed experimental design should be included here. If there more than table or figure, label or title them.

## Notes
An option section for miscellaneous observations and notes. The results and discussion sections should relate directly to the purpose stated in that section, so this section is appropriate for potential protocol optimizations or stray musings, for example.

# Example Results
Include any example results that illustrate potential outcomes of the experiment.
