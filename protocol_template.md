## Purpose/Introduction
Briefly describe the background of the experiment, referencing any necessary publications or sources and prior experiments. Include the hypothesis tested or the information intended to be gained. If applicable, add an overview of the experimental design that can be understood at a glance, including the major test and control groups and the independent and dependent variables. This can be written for a general audience or a more specialist audience. Any big modifications or changes that is unique to this protocol. Any major notes/changes.

# Materials (aka Crap you need)
Essential, important, or rare/specific materials should be recorded. When possible, include the catalog number - make a note if it's important to order directly from the source. Basic materials like 1.5ml eppendorf tubes or pipette tips do not need to be included UNLESS it's important or makes a difference in the protocol. Definitely make a note if it's important.  

More information is generally better, but do not distract from the content by including trivial examples. 

# Solutions (aka crap you need to make)
Include instructions for any necessary solutions. If you want to include the recipe you used for a typical volume you make. Also include storage information and how often you have to make it - when it "expires".

# Protocol
## Before you begin (optional)
- if you need to get stuff ready ahead of time
- if you have specific tips that need to be remembered
## Subsection1
1.	Break long procedures into appropriate subsections. Make notes if multiple days.
2.	Keep the steps brief but informative.
	1.	Include supplemental information and caveats as a substep. Multiple substeps and sub-substeps are strongly discouraged.

## Subsection2
3.	Numbering can be maintained or restarted between sections
4.	Detailed experimental design should be included here. If there more than table or figure, label or title them.


# Conclusion (optional)
## Example Results
Include any example results that illustrate potential outcomes of the experiment.
## Notes/Tips
- An option section for miscellaneous observations and notes. The results and discussion sections should relate directly to the purpose stated in that section, so this section is appropriate for potential protocol optimizations or stray musings, for example.
- Colloraborative notes - if you've used it for a different purpose.
