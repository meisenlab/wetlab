## Single-embryo RNA Extraction

Adapted from: [Lott et al 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?type=printable&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000590) and Trizol Manufacturer's Protocol

**Things you need to do prior to prior to sorting embryos**

* Clean the 6 dounces with MilliQ and place kimwipes down in the hood so they can dry, I normally lean them up against a rack with the opening facing down so the water drains out

* Label all of your embryo collection baskets
* Put  PBT into eppendorf tubes
* Prepare bleach solution
* Put the 200 uL pipette, tips, slides, and needle poker by the sorting microscope in the fly room
* Get your mise en place ready in the hood with a 1000 uL pipette, tips, dry & liquid waste bag & bottle, Trizol, and a dedicated Trizol paintbrush, 

**Harvest and Sort Embryos**

1. Harvest, dechorionate, and sort 6 embryos to whatever stage you like. 
   * For RT-qPCR of maternally deposited RNAs: 90 minute collection and 70 minute age
   * This should put them at about late stage 3 and early stage 4 before maternal RNAs are cleared 

**Homogenize Embryos**

2. Pipette 1 mL of Trizol into each dounce

3. Transfer 1 embryo into each dounce with the dedicated Trizol paintbrush

4. Dounce 8-10x with separate handles 

5. Freeze at -80 C or continue with extraction. 
   * I would recommend freezing, then extracting multiple batches at the same time later. 
   * The following part takes me about 4 hours for 10 samples. 

_Make sure to rinse dounces and brush into the liquid fix waste container in the hood before cleaning them at the sink because Trizol contains phenol!_

**Lyse Samples and Separate Phases** 

6. Incubate (rotating) for 5 minutes to permit complete dissociation of nucleoproteins complex. 
   * Go ahead and fast temp the centrifuge to 4 C here 

7. Add 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL Trizol and incubate (rotating) for 2-3 minutes.

8. Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 12,000 g at 4 C. 
   * The mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform, interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase

9. Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at 45 degrees and pipetting the solution out. 
   * Tip: I just always set my pipette to 500 uL at this step that's about how much you can get without touching the interphase/organic layer which you don’t want to do. It might leave a little bit leftover but getting the rest isn’t worth the hassle.  

_Save interphase and organic phase if you want to isolate DNA or protein see manufacturer's protocol_

**Precipitate the RNA** 

10. Add 1 uL Glycoblue to each tube and mix. 
    * Glycogen is an inert carrier used to help resuspend nucleic acids. Glycoblue is amazing because it's blue. If you don't use either here, I can guarantee it will be impossible to see the pellet. 

11. Add 0.5 mL of isopropanol to the aqueous phase per 1 mL of Trizol used for lysis. 

12. Incubate (rotating) for 10 minutes. 

13. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 12,000 g at 4 C 
    * Total RNA precipitate forms a blue gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube

14. Discard the supernatant.

**Wash the RNA**

15. Resuspend (it won’t totally dissolve) the pellet in 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of Trizol used for lysis.
    * RNA can be stored in 75% ethanol for at least 1 year at -20 C or 1 week at 4 C. 

16. Vortex the sample briefly, then centrifuge for 5 minutes at 7500 g at 4 C. 

17. Discard all of the supernatant that is humanly possible without fucking up the pellet

18. Air-dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes

**Solubilize the RNA**

19. Resuspend the pellet in 20-50 uL of RNase-free water or TE by pipetting up and down.
    * It's easier to resuspend nucleic acids in TE and they're generally more stable. The water bath/heat block step is to help with resuspension, so the water bath or heat block may not always be necessary. 

20. Incubate in water bath or heat block at 55-60 C for 10-15 minutes. 

Yay you’re almost done! At this point I usually immediately follow it up with a Turbo DNase treatment because it doesn’t take long and I just follow the manufacturer’s protocol. If I don’t have time to run the bioanalyzer also, I usually leave the samples at 4C overnight and run them in the morning. For long term storage, the RNA samples should be kept at -80 C. If you're planning on using them semi-regularly, -20 C is fine.
